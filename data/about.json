  "whatIBuild": "Microservice architectures, observability platforms, and global system integrations. Migrated monolithic systems to 60+ services, built full tracing stacks with SkyWalking/OTel, and delivered cross-border integrations with overseas third-party platforms.",
  "howIThink": "Observability first — if you can't see it, you can't fix it. Prefer incremental migration over big rewrites. Contribute upstream when the tool doesn't do what you need. Keep services small, contracts explicit, and deployments boring.",
  "currentExploration": "Building an AI voice ordering and reservation product. Developing blockchain and wallet projects to transition into Web3. Interested in AI agent applications and on-chain system design."
